Wentao Yang's demo

Hi everyone,
This is Wentao Yang's website for self-recording computer graphics learning process.
Brief Introduction: I am a NYU Computer Engineering master student, currently doing reseaching in computer graphics lab supervised by Prof. Gizem Kayar. 
Our proposed project is interactive ML-driven terrain generator.

I will continously update my research process.

I also did some glsl coding on gsn.org, i will include those practices in the future.

1. The code in folder 'Image Test' can read a .obj file and rasterize it. This is my first c++ program done in my undergraduate.

2. Noise generator is a c# script coded in Unity for terrain generation

3. Unity shaders contains shaders for simple lighting models, like blinn phong and soft shadows.
